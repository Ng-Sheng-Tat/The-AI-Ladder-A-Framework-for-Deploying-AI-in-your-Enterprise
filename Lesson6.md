## Final Step in the Ladder: Infuse (Operationalize) AI
**Infuse AI**
The infuse step of the ladder focuses on applying AI throughout the business.

AI solutions can be leveraged across your business within various processes from payroll to customer care to marketing benefiting from its ability to draw on predictions, automation, and optimization. Infusing AI helps you advance your business agenda.   

Most organizations are still in the early days of determining how and where to use AI, but there is tremendous optimism.

According to Gartner:
- 37 percent of companies are adopting AI in some form or fashion.
- 52 percent of telecommunications firms, for example, are already deploying chatbots bolstered by AI to improve customer experiences and services.
- 49 percent of enterprises are already changing their business models to integrate and adopt new technological solutions throughout their internal processes and supply chains.  

IBM (building on projects with thousands of organizations) has observed that organizations are looking to:

1. Speed time to value with pre-built AI apps for common use case (for example, customer service and financial planning)
2. Automate knowledge work and business processes
3. Employ AI-assisted business intelligence and data visualization
4. Automate planning, budgeting, and forecasting analytics
5. Customize with industry vertical AI-driven frameworks Innovate with new business models intelligently powered by AI

Examples
Marketing: Companies can **predict shopping trends and optimize their marketing strategies** and product placement or deliver ads that are engaging, relevant, and personal.     

Supply chain: Companies have visibility and insights to **make informed decisions and mitigate disruptions** before they impact their ability to deliver business results.  

Customer care: Enterprises are looking to **transform their customer experience, deliver fast resolution and provide round-the-clock accessibility**. Increasingly, they are turning to conversational solutions, often referred to as chatbots, to tackle the most common interactions, questions, and tasks.

Human resources: Companies can **predict with accuracy which employees are at risk of attrition**. AI also can be used to help employees identify new skills training, education, job promotions, and raises.

Knowledge workers like procurement professionals and lawyers can **craft and manage contracts and legal documents with less effort and more accuracy, saving both time and money**.

Insurance: With AI, the claims approval process for insurance carriers is **more consistent and automated, can more accurately predict risk assessments, and ensure fair outcomes for customers**. This allows their employees to focus on higher-value tasks while still allowing their employees to explain how those AI decisions were made.

Enterprise Financial Planning:  By investing in an AI-powered financial analytics solution, organizations **can develop next-generation CFOs who can apply predictive analytics and unlock the value previously hidden in their data**. This allows organizations to **break free of manual, error-prone work**.  

**Real-life example of Infuse AI**
A global, independent energy company has been a world leader in oil and gas exploration for over 50 years.  What is their key to success?

They hire and develop some of the worldâ€™s best engineering experts. This approach has helped the company to create some of the largest structures on earth, in some of the most remotest seas, and to safely transport the energy it extracts around the globe.

This company knew that it had to harness the institutional knowledge of its best engineers.  By harnessing the power of AI, the company was able to extract meaningful insights from 30 years of complex engineering data and reports, and then make this knowledge easily available to employees across the company. This helped the organization answer tough questions faster to enable fact-driven decision making on complex projects.

**Infuse AI** refers to putting AI (and the underlying data) to work (involves not only the technologies but also new skills throughout the organization). It will change the way people work by creating new workflows and business processes that are driven by machine learning models.
The goal is to **Augmented Human Intelligence: Giving humans prediction, optimization, and automation tools to make better-informed decisions."
The solutions AI provided must be easily scalable, and can be retrained for more functionalities easily. The data across the enterprise is fully ultilized.
Now you have modernized your information architecture. The AI ladder journey is a cycle that loops never stops.
