## No AI without IA
**Data is the fuel of AI.** Hence, a solid information management architecture that provides the right data to the right teams at the right time is important for successful implementation of AI solution.

**Modernizing your information architecture**
In order to prepare your data for AI and hybrid cloud, and to make the journey to AI possible, it is important for your organization to build a reliable information architecture (IA) that is efficient and agile.

The architecture that your organization creates will be the most successful if it is an **elastic and extensible multicloud infrastructure** that unifies key capabilities around:

- collecting
- organizing
- analyzing, and
- infusing data

**Modernize** means building an information architecture for AI that provides choices and flexibility across your business. As you modernize your data estates for an AI and multicloud world, you will find that there is less work required to expand and infuse AI throughout your business processes.  

**AI is not magic**
AI is not magic. It’s computer science. There is no magical wand that exists to fix enterprise inefficiencies, and access to the technology is not enough. AI adoption necessitates a thoughtful approach with an efficient, well thought-out information architecture.

The vast majority of AI failures are due to the lack of data preparation and organization, not the AI models or use cases. There are three major challenges organizations must overcome to truly transform into an AI-first company:
1. Data: Either too much data, not enough data or bad, irrelevant data.
2. Skills: AI skills are new, rare, and in high demand.
3. Trust: The decisions made with AI systems must be accountable, traceable

This course will focus primarily on the first challenge listed above, data.  

**There is no AI without IA**
There is no AI without __Information Architecture (IA)__. IA is the practice of structuring data for a purpose. For the purpose of AI, IA’s purpose is to __create a unified, organized data collection that can drive analysis on a multicloud platform__.

Creating the appropriate IA allows your organization to have the ability to simplify and automate the process of transforming data into insights using machine learning models, as well as implementing other AI tools and capabilities.

We need data to be easily available, and the data should be structured, complete, consistent, and reliable, which can be achieved by
1. "Fit-for-purpose" data architecture with data available in the right format for individual needs.
2. All data is cataloged and searchable via metadata, collections, terms.
3. Development and enforcement of policies and procedures for ensuring data quality.

The information architecture needs the following characteristics:
1. Flexible enough for (cloud) **platform agnostic** (Works flexibly with a wide variety of different storage and application platforms)
2. Able to connect to data sources easily
3. Able to produce reliable data
