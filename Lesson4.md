## Second Step in the Ladder: Organize Data
To organize the technology, processes, and people so that data is used efficiently. Things like finalizing data governance, ensuring data quality and security, ensuring privacy and compliance, and providing "one source of truth" for everyone in the enterprise should be done.

**Organizing your data**
When organizations are able to collect their data and make it accessible throughout their business, the next step is to make sure it’s organized in a trusted, business-ready foundation.  

Data is the bread and butter of AI and the quality of that data directly affects the results of the organization's AI. **Organizations need their data to be organized, cataloged, and governed to ensure that only the people who should be able to access it have the appropriate access rights.**  

To understand why it’s important to organize and catalog data, an analogy of a grocery store is useful. When you go to a grocery store, all of the products are sorted by aisle and each aisle has a list of categories hanging overhead. Grocery stores are useful because they are organized and provide an overhead catalog to help shoppers quickly find what they need. If a grocery store was simply a room filled with thousands of products, it would have less value to its shoppers. Shoppers would waste time looking for products they would not be organized in a logical way.

Data is the same. Organizations need to have a **catalog of their data that provides information, including the data’s source, who owns it, and how the metadata is mapped to its business context**.  Organizing data properly helps companies:

- Profile, cleanse, and catalog all types of data
- Manage data with built-in protection and compliance
- Enable policy-driven visibility, detection, and reporting
- Manage data at all stages of the information lifecycle, from creation to deletion

**Poor Data Governance** refers to data that is not catalogued, organized, and governed.
Keys element in **Organize**:
1. Data is trustworthy, complete, and consistent
2. Data catalog and governance
3. Data compliance

**Organize** means that the data is ready for use by business users. They should be:
1. well-addressed data quality (cleansed and ready to be used, and well defined policy for those can used and have access to it and those who does not)
2. organized and catalogued data (collection of rules, profiles, tags, and policies that are used to regulate the use of data)
  - it allows for the automated regulation of many aspects of data quality, including maintaining metadata, data privacy, and relationships between data assets.
  - data catalogs include data topology and essential business terms for structured data
  - catalogs help to enforce the defined topology by using policies and rules, establishing lineage (questions on 5W1H on the origin of data), and adding unstructured data.
3. governed data
  - is about ensuring that data is accessed and used by those with permission to do so.
  - hiring a data steward (to make sure technical tools are implemented for governance and that policies and procedures are followed. )
By implementing policies and procedures, making sure everyone is trained on them, and by using automated processes where available, the quality of the new data infrastructure are high enough.
