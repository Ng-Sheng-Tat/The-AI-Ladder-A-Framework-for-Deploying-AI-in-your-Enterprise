## First Step in the Ladder: Collect Data
Start collecting quality data in bigger amount (of all types and from all sources) and in a easy manner is first step in AI Architecture.

Data characteristics:
1. Easily accessible across staff
2. Insights should by available throughout the organization

**Collect: Making Data simple and accessible**
After you've modernized your information architecture, it is time to make your **data simple and accessible**.    

What does "simple and accessible" mean?  To understand this, consider what it looks like when data are not simple and accessible:   
1. Data locked away in systems-of-record, inaccessible to most
2. Data silos isolated by inflexible platforms that cannot interface with other platforms

**Siloed business functions and data types**  

Siloed data means data that cannot be used for gaining analytical insights.  As your business grows and evolves, these basic challenges tend to get worse.  In the end, no amount of AI will help transform an organization with siloed data because the insights gained by AI are only as good as the data used to derive those insights.  

For organizations that want to adopt AI solutions, access to data is critical to create smarter, transparent, and trusted AI applications.

For example, consider a retail company that currently only has access to their historical, transactional data. That means their AI models are being trained using only one data source.

If instead this company combined their structured transactional data with unstructured data from sources like social-media data or real-time clickstreams, they would be able to build AI models that tell what their customers bought last week, how they feel about their purchases, and what they’re shopping for this very second, giving the retail company a multi-dimensional view of their customers.

**An appropriate data management strategy is critical**
An appropriate hybrid data-management strategy will allow companies to successfully implement AI. To implement this strategy, focus on how your employees will have:

1. Access to all data regardless of source or type
2. Flexibility to support changing workloads and consumption cases
3. Access to intelligent analytics, such as machine learning, that can run at the source of data
4. Access to insights across the business, its functions, and to all users for better decision making

**Structured data exists in pre-defined, searchable, and standardized database models. Unstructured data is “everything else” that does not fall into an organized database model, such as documents, audio files, or video files.**

**The collect step of the AI ladder**
1. Understanding business challenges faced by the different business units
2. Using all the available data (identified and mapped data for all the departments)
3. Use AI-powered tools (NLP) to manage data
